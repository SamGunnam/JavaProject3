The Roesch Library needs a new electronic rental system, and we need to build it by prioritizing the software is easy to use for the students. 
Roesch Library has two library sections. Each section offers many books to rent. Students can print the list of available books, borrow, and return books.
We are creating an interactive graphical user interface using JavaFx for Roesch Library which is an electronic rental system.
